# Convolutional Neural Networks
## Neural Networks and Representation Learning
Neural networks initially receive data on observations, with each observation represented by some number n features.
A simple neural network model with one hidden layer performed better than a model without that hidden layer. Why is that? One reason, as I showed in the case of the house prices data, is that the neural network could learn **nonlinear relationships between input and output**. However, a more general reason is that **in machine learning, we often need linear combinations of our original features** in order to effectively predict our target.
